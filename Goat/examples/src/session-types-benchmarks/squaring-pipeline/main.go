// Command squaring-pipeline comes from Golang blog to demonstrate fan-in and
// explicit cancellation. This is a modified example of the example.

// Source: https://blog.golang.org/pipelines
package main

// GoLive: replaced fmt.Println with println

// The first stage, gen, is a function that converts a list of integers to a
// channel that emits the integers in the list. The gen function starts a
// goroutine that sends the integers on the channel and closes the channel when
// all the values have been sent:
func gen(nums ...int) <-chan int {
	out := make(chan int)
	go func() {
		for _, n := range nums {
			out <- n
		}
		close(out)
	}()
	return out
}

// The second stage, sq, receives integers from a channel and returns a channel
// that emits the square of each received integer. After the inbound channel is
// closed and this stage has sent all the values downstream, it closes the
// outbound channel:
func sq(in <-chan int) <-chan int {
	out := make(chan int)
	go func() {
		for n := range in {
			out <- n * n
		}
		close(out)
	}()
	return out
}

// The main function sets up the pipeline and runs the final stage: it receives
// values from the second stage and prints each one, until the channel is
// closed:
func main() {
	// Set up the pipeline and consume the output.
	for n := range sq(sq(gen(2, 3))) {
		println(n) // 15 then 81
	}
}
